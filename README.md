##### Assembly releases
#### V1.0
### Complete T2T reconstruction of a human genome, with the exception of 5 known gaps within the rDNA arrays. Polished assembly based on v0.9. Introduces 4 structural corrections and 993 small variant corrections, including a 4 kb telomere extension on chr18. Polishing was performed using a conservative custom pipeline based on DeepVariant calls and structural corrections were manually curated. Consensus quality exceeds Q60. Prior to a preprint being drafted, a brief summary can be found at this blog post. Also available at NCBI. Changes made from v0.9 to v1.0 are available as a VCF.
